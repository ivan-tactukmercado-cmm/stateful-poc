# BAMOE Kogito Stateful Process Service
This module contains an example `BAMOE (Kogito) Stateful Process Service`, using the using Kogito and packaged as a micro-service JAR. 

# How To Build 
Once you have configured your local development environment, you need to perform a Maven `build` of the repository.  This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  If deploying artifacts to an enterprise Maven repository, please use `mvn clean deploy`, which requires configuration of the `distributionManagement` section of your project's parent pom.xml.  This project is also configured to generate container images automatically by utilizing the `docker` or `openshift` profiles, as in the following examples:

```shell
mvn clean package -Pdocker
```

```shell
mvn clean package -Popenshift
```

# How To Run in Development Mode
Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode, which means you can update the application sources, resources and configurations. The changes are automatically reflected in your running application. This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.  Dev mode enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect. This works too for resource files like the configuration property file. The act of refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the Java files are compiled, and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.  To run the service in Quarkus Dev Mode, use the following command:

```shell
mvn clean package quarkus:dev -Pdev
```

# How To Test
There are various methods used to test this application's REST API endpoints.  Included in the `src/test/resources/rest` folder is a set of example test cases using the [VS Code REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).  

# Start with Swagger
In order to determine which REST endpoints have been published by the application, you simply need to start your application, either in Quarkus Dev Mode or via the published container image, and then navigate to the published swagger page at:  [Swagger Page](http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/).  

# Create Unit Tests
You are free to use any unit testing framework you choose, so long as it can call Java or REST API methods programmatically, such as:

- [Using REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)
- [Using Quarkus for Unit Testing](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing)
- [Using JUnit for Unit Testing](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)

- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/) - Traditional Java stacks were engineered for monolithic applications with long startup times and large memory requirements in a world where the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes did not exist. Java frameworks needed to evolve to meet the needs of this new world.  Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.  You can find a useful introdution to this technology at [**Getting Started with Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io/get-started/).
